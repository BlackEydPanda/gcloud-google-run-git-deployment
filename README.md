### Google Run Function Deployment testground
This REPO was created to test Google Run Function Deployment.
In order to see the deployment check the workflows file for the python deployment. Could it be cleaner? Possibly, but mission accomplished so who cares, its a test ground luv.
GCP project has been since removed so pushing into main will not redeploy anymore. Based on Kyle Venn's answer on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77337407/deploy-gen2-google-cloud-functions-with-github-actions
